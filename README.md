# The DMV

### BE MOD 1 DMV PROJECT - ANDY STILMOCK

## Digging into the existing codebase

  # -What was my process, define process.
Initially, I began with reading through the iteration 1 directions before diving into the code in order to get a good grip on the expectations and setup for this project. After cloning the repo to my computer and diving into the preexisting files - I just started at the top of the list in the library files, looking at the library file then the corresponding test file in the spec folder. As I went through the files I took some notes on what I was confident I would be able to figure out/complete for the steps listed in the interaction pattern but also, took notes on the lines of code that I did not understand or knew I would need some further questioning and research on to take a look at when I started working through the tests and interaction patterns for the project. 

  # -Difficulties of working with preexisting code
Really the only difficulties are the unknown items - methods or tests written in a way I don't understand or have not learned yet     (.parse as an example). However, with this being an expected challenge after completing Turing that would be required when diving into any existing codebase in the future - this is a welcome challenge. 

  # -Anything easier than expected, describe what and why, anything that would have helped with comfortability
The one takeaway so far is just getting the evrironment for the project setup and getting going on the initial steps is much less difficult when the files and tests already exist and I can simply jump in and start working through the interaction pattern steps and preexisting tests.
