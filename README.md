## Digging into the existing codebase

  ### - Describe the steps you took to dig in to this code base. What was your process? If you don’t feel you had a process, define one that you might like to try next time.
Initially, I began with reading through the iteration 1 directions before diving into the code in order to get a good grip on the expectations and setup for this project. After cloning the repo to my computer and diving into the preexisting files - I just started at the top of the list in the library files, looking at the library file then the corresponding test file in the spec folder. As I went through the files I took some notes on what I was confident I would be able to figure out/complete for the steps listed in the interaction pattern but also, took notes on the lines of code that I did not understand or knew I would need some further questioning and research on to take a look at when I started working through the tests and interaction patterns for the project. 

  ### - What was hard about working with code you did not write?
Really the only difficulties are the unknown items - methods or tests written in a way I don't understand or have not learned yet     (.parse as an example). However, with this being an expected challenge after completing Turing that would be required when diving into any existing codebase in the future - this is a welcome challenge. 

  ### - What was easier than you expected about jumping in to an unfamiliar codebase? What made it easy? If nothing felt easy, what would’ve helped you feel more comfortable more quickly?
The one takeaway so far is just getting the evrironment for the project setup and getting going on the initial steps is much less difficult when the files and tests already exist and I can simply jump in and start working through the interaction pattern steps and preexisting tests.
